## FAQ Section
```
1. What can Tarot Card Reading help me with?
Tarot is a mirror to your subconscious. It helps you gain clarity in relationships, career, finances, and personal growth. With over three decades of guiding clients, including celebrities, I use Tarot to provide direction and uncover solutions you may not see yourself.

2. How is Numerology different from Astrology?
Astrology is the study of cosmic forces through your birth chart, while Numerology decodes the hidden power of numbers in your name and date of birth. Together, they reveal your destiny, strengths, challenges, and the right timings for important life events.

3. Can Vastu really change my life?
Yes. Vastu Shastra is about aligning your home and workspace with universal energies. When balanced correctly, your environment supports prosperity, harmony, and well-being. Many clients have experienced peace and success after simple yet powerful changes in their spaces.

4. How do you handle Black Magic or negative energy issues?
As a Tantracharya, I have mastered techniques of Tantra to neutralize dark energies and spiritual blockages. Through rituals, mantras, and spiritual empowerment, I help clients overcome black magic influences and restore balance to their lives.

5. What is Angel Healing and how does it work?
Angel Healing is a gentle yet powerful method where I channel angelic energies to heal emotional wounds, release fear, and bring peace. It connects you with your guardian angels, allowing divine light to flow into your life.

6. Can Crystal Healing really improve my well-being?
Yes. Crystals carry vibrational energies that resonate with our mind, body, and spirit. By placing them strategically or using them during healing sessions, I help clients balance emotions, reduce stress, and attract positive energy.

7. Who should consult Agnni Predictions?
Anyone seeking clarity, healing, or solutions‚Äîwhether you're facing personal struggles, career blocks, relationship issues, or feeling spiritually stuck. Dr. Pranjal D Sharma have guided over 10,000 people, from common individuals to Bollywood stars, to transform challenges into opportunities.

### **Project: Agnni Predictions - Premium UX/UI & Animation Overhaul**

**Objective:** Transform the current website from an amateurish implementation into a breathtaking, industry-leading digital experience that embodies luxury, mysticism, and divine elegance. The goal is to create a site so visually stunning and seamlessly interactive that it becomes a reference point for premium spiritual services.

**Core Philosophy:** The website should feel less like a webpage and more like a **cinematic, interactive journey**. Every scroll, hover, and click should feel intentional, smooth, and magical.

---

### **1. Mandatory Foundations (The "What")**

*   **Assets:** A complete inventory of all provided images (backgrounds, crystals, logos, services) and videos (`angel-healing.mp4`, `fairy.mp4`, `loader.mp4`, etc.) has been documented. **Every single asset must be utilized thoughtfully.** No asset is to be left unused.
*   **Content:** All required text content, service details, FAQs, and contact information from the `requirements.md` file are final and must be integrated.
*   **Brand Identity:** Strict adherence to the **Purple & White** color scheme, with accents of gold or soft shimmer for a premium touch. The theme of **Angels, Fairies, and Heavenly Nature** is paramount.

---

### **2. The Problem with the Current State (The "Why")**

The current site fails on every front of premium design:
*   **UX is terrible:** Navigation is confusing, flow is illogical, and user goals (booking, buying) are not intuitively supported.
*   **UI is terrible:** Layout is generic, typography is weak, spacing is poor, and it lacks any visual hierarchy or sophistication.
*   **Animations are annoying:** They are jarring, poorly implemented, and detract from the content rather than enhancing it.
*   **Zero Premium Feel:** It looks cheap and does not reflect the 30+ years of expertise and high-profile clientele. It undermines the brand.

---

### **3. Vision for the New Experience (The "How")**

#### **A. Overall Design & Layout**
*   **Philosophy:** Embrace a "less is more" approach with bold, impactful sections. Use ample negative space to let content and visuals breathe.
*   **Typography:** Implement a sophisticated serif font (e.g., Cinzel, Playfair Display) for headings and a clean, highly readable sans-serif for body text. Perfect kerning and leading are non-negotiable.
*   **Layout:** Break away from boring rectangular sections. Use layered divs with soft gradients, subtle shapes, and the provided particle-overlay and bokeh-glitter backgrounds to create depth and dimension. Think of it as designing a haute couture dress, not off-the-rack clothing.

#### **B. Section-to-Section Page Transitions**
Scrolling should be a narrative experience.
*   **Smooth Triggered Animations:** As the user scrolls, new sections should not just appear. They should **animate into view**.
    *   Use `Anime.js` or `GSAP` to create sequences where background images (e.g., `tarot-altar.webp`) fade in, text content elegantly slides and fades up, and graphical elements (like a floating fairy from `fairy.mp4`) traverse the screen.
    *   **Example:** Transitioning from the "Services" section to the "About" section could involve the purple gradient background morphing into the amethyst-crystals background, with crystal graphics animating along the path.

#### **C. Extraordinary Intra-Section Animations**
Every component within a section must have a purpose and a polish.
*   **Service Cards:** On hover, a service card should not just shadow. The associated image should gently zoom, a soft light glow (using the provided glow effects) should emanate from it, and the "Book Now" CTA should slide up gracefully. The background of the card could reveal a subtle video loop (e.g., `candlelit-tarot.webp` for Tarot reading).
*   **Testimonials:** Implement a premium, custom-built carousel. Testimonials should fade in and out with overlapping animations, accompanied by a soft, sparkle trail (using the cursor effect logic) as they transition.
*   **Crystal Products:** Display the crystal bracelets in a 3D carousel or an interactive grid. Each crystal image must be high-resolution and clickable to view a stunning modal with a detailed description and the `chat-gpt` sourced copy. Use a lightbox effect with a dark, focused overlay to emphasize luxury.

#### **D. The Preloader**
The current preloader is unacceptable.
*   **Replacement:** **You must use the provided `loader.mp4` video.** Implement it as a full-screen, seamless preloader.
*   **Execution:** The video should play once at full quality. Once the page assets are loaded, the video should smoothly fade out or morph into the website's hero section. This sets the premium, mystical tone immediately upon arrival.

#### **E. The Cursor Effect**
The provided sparkle code is a good base but needs refinement.
*   **Enhancement:** **Keep the trailing sparkle effect,** but make it more elegant. The sparkles should be smaller, more refined, and use a palette of white, soft purple, and gold.
*   **Integration:** This effect should not exist in isolation. It should interact with the page:
    *   Sparkles should collect and swirl around CTAs like "Book a Consultation."
    *   Hovering over clickable elements should change the cursor to a subtle, magical icon (e.g., a tiny fairy or crystal) and intensify the sparkle effect around it.

#### **F. Video Integration**
The videos are critical for the cinematic feel.
*   **Background Videos:** Use `angel-healing.mp4` or `pain-to-peace.mp4` as subtle, looped, muted background videos in key hero sections with a white or purple overlay to ensure text readability.
*   **Contextual Videos:** Use `horoscope.mp4` as a background in the Astrological Predictions service section.

---

### **Directive for the Developer/Designer:**

You are not just implementing a design brief. You are an artist crafting a divine digital artifact. Your mandate is to use the full power of `Anime.js`, `GSAP`, and CSS3 to create a website that is:

1.  **Visually Stunning:** A feast for the eyes that never feels cluttered.
2.  **Butter-Smooth:** Every animation must run at 60fps. Performance is part of premium.
3.  **Intuitively Navigable:** The breathtaking UX must guide the user effortlessly to conversion (contact form, product purchase).
4.  **Memorably Unique:** This site should not look like any other spiritual site. It should be a benchmark.

**Final Note:** Do not hold back. Be bold, creative, and meticulous. The client's assets are your palette; modern web animation libraries are your brush. Paint a masterpiece.


---


### **Project: Agnni Predictions - Phase 2: Premium Page Consistency & Animation Refinement**

**Objective:** Elevate every single page of the website to the same premium standard as the homepage, creating a seamless, luxurious, and highly usable journey. The goal is to fix critical UX failures, implement world-class animation choreography, and ensure every interaction feels intentional, polished, and divine.

**Core Principle:** **Consistency is King.** The design language, animation philosophy, and user experience must be uniform across all pages to build a trustworthy and high-value brand identity.

---

### **1. Critical UX & Usability Fixes (The Non-Negotiables)**

*   **Modal & Accessibility Disaster:** The product card modal is completely broken.
    *   **Fix:** The modal must be a true, focus-trapped modal. **The cursor must be contained within it.** The background must be dimmed with a semi-transparent overlay (`particle-overlay.webp` could work here tastefully). The modal must be closable via a prominent "X" button, the ESC key, and by clicking outside of it. This is priority zero.
*   **Logo Visibility:** The current logo is ineffective.
    *   **Fix:** Implement a **context-aware logo system**. Use the provided `agnni-logo-stacked.webp` but create two versions:
        1.  A **light version** for dark backgrounds (e.g., hero sections with dark videos).
        2.  A **dark version** (or a version with a subtle white stroke/shadow) for light backgrounds.
    The logo must always have strong contrast against its immediate background.
*   **Form Usability:** All forms (Contact, Consultation Booking) are currently subpar.
    *   **Fix:** Redesign all forms from the ground up using the requirements in `requirements.md`. They must have:
        *   Elegant, minimalistic labels with smooth float-label animation on focus.
        *   Subtle, purposeful hover and focus states (e.g., a soft purple glow).
        *   Clearly defined error states and validation messages.
        *   A polished, high-contrast submit button.

---

### **2. Global Animation & Scrolling Overhaul**

The current animations are present but lack sophistication and control.

*   **Animation Choreography:** **Sections must animate sequentially.** Implement a system using `GSAP ScrollTrigger` and `Anime.js` where a section's animations (text fade-up, image parallax, element transitions) **must complete** before the next section begins its entrance sequence. This creates a narrative, chapter-by-chapter feel, not a chaotic free-for-all.
*   **Scroll Behavior:** Smooth scrolling is mandatory. The scroll speed should feel weighty and intentional, not light and flimsy.

---

### **3. Page-by-Page Premium Enhancement Plan**

#### **A. Homepage Refinement (The Foundation)**
*   **Hero Section:** The single video background is good but not extraordinary.
    *   **Action:** Replace it with a **premium, auto-rotating carousel**. This is the main event. Each slide should be a high-impact, full-screen visual:
        *   **Slide 1:** A subtly looped, muted video (`angel-healing.mp4` or `fairy.mp4`) with a text overlay.
        *   **Slide 2:** A stunning, high-resolution photograph (`tarot-altar.webp` or `candlelit-tarot.webp`) with a delicate, CSS-animated particle effect over it.
        *   **Slide 3:** A dynamic background using the `astrology-zodiac.webp` or `horoscope.mp4` video with a slow, mesmerizing zoom pan.
    *   The transition between slides should be a seamless, crossfade animation. No cheap sliding.
*   **Section Audit:** **Remove the FAQ section from the homepage** as per the client's latest instruction. Add any missing sections mandated by the `requirements.md` (e.g., ensure "Why Choose Us" is present and beautifully designed).

#### **B. Services / Consultation Page (This is the Product)**
*   **Current State:** Terrible. This is a core revenue page and must be flawless.
*   **Vision:** Each service should be a masterpiece. **Use the `horoscope.mp4` video as a full-section background** for the Astrology service block. Use `glowing-healing-hands.webp` for Crystal Healing. Match the asset to the service for an immersive experience.
*   **Layout:** Move away from a simple list. Use a dynamic layout: perhaps an elegant grid on one side and a sticky, detailed service description on the other that updates as the user hovers or scrolls through options.
*   **Interaction:** Hovering over a service name should trigger a gentle, related animation in the background (e.g., hovering over "Angel Reading" makes a faint, ethereal light pass through the section).

#### **C. About Us Page**
*   **Current State:** Lacks the emotional connection and premium feel.
*   **Vision:** This is Dr. Pranjal's story. It should feel reverent and established.
    *   Use a layered design with a large, elegant portrait photo.
    *   Implement a timeline or milestone counter for her "30+ Years of Experience" using a subtle counting animation.
    *   Text should be broken into easily digestible blocks with ample spacing. Use serif fonts to convey authority and tradition.

#### **D. Products / Shop Page**
*   **Current State:** Uninspired and non-functional.
*   **Vision:** A luxury e-commerce gallery. Display the crystal bracelets against clean, dark backgrounds (use `amethyst-crystals.webp` as a textural backdrop). Each product must have:
    *   A high-res image that can be zoomed.
    *   A beautifully typeset description.
    *   The "Add to Sacred Cart" button must be a premium CTA.
*   **The Sacred Cart:** The cart itself must be a modal or slide-in panel that reflects the site's mystical theme (e.g., a dark overlay with a soft purple glow).

#### **E. Contact Us Page**
*   **Current State:** Generic.
*   **Vision:** Integrate the consultation timings and address into the design elegantly. Don't just list them; style them. Perhaps use an icon system. The form is the centerpiece here and must be the premium form described earlier.

---

### **Directive for the Developer/Designer:**

You are moving from the "foundation" to the "finishings." Your focus is now on **consistency, polish, and flawless interaction.**

1.  **Audit Every Page:** Go through the site page-by-page and ruthlessly align every element (spacing, fonts, button styles, card styles) with the refined homepage.
2.  **Choreograph, Don't Animate:** Think of yourself as a director. Each scroll is a scene change. Each hover is a actor's cue. The animations must tell a story and guide the user's eye.
3.  **Pixel-Perfect Polish:** The difference between good and premium is in the details: a 1px border, a 0.2s longer easing function, a perfectly balanced gradient. Obsess over the details.
4.  **Test Relentlessly:** Especially the fixed modal and form interactions. The site must feel robust and professional on all devices.

This phase is about proving that every page can be as extraordinary as the homepage aims to be. Make it seamless. Make it premium.
