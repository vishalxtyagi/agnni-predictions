## FAQ Section
```
1. What can Tarot Card Reading help me with?
Tarot is a mirror to your subconscious. It helps you gain clarity in relationships, career, finances, and personal growth. With over three decades of guiding clients, including celebrities, I use Tarot to provide direction and uncover solutions you may not see yourself.

2. How is Numerology different from Astrology?
Astrology is the study of cosmic forces through your birth chart, while Numerology decodes the hidden power of numbers in your name and date of birth. Together, they reveal your destiny, strengths, challenges, and the right timings for important life events.

3. Can Vastu really change my life?
Yes. Vastu Shastra is about aligning your home and workspace with universal energies. When balanced correctly, your environment supports prosperity, harmony, and well-being. Many clients have experienced peace and success after simple yet powerful changes in their spaces.

4. How do you handle Black Magic or negative energy issues?
As a Tantracharya, I have mastered techniques of Tantra to neutralize dark energies and spiritual blockages. Through rituals, mantras, and spiritual empowerment, I help clients overcome black magic influences and restore balance to their lives.

5. What is Angel Healing and how does it work?
Angel Healing is a gentle yet powerful method where I channel angelic energies to heal emotional wounds, release fear, and bring peace. It connects you with your guardian angels, allowing divine light to flow into your life.

6. Can Crystal Healing really improve my well-being?
Yes. Crystals carry vibrational energies that resonate with our mind, body, and spirit. By placing them strategically or using them during healing sessions, I help clients balance emotions, reduce stress, and attract positive energy.

7. Who should consult Agnni Predictions?
Anyone seeking clarity, healing, or solutions—whether you're facing personal struggles, career blocks, relationship issues, or feeling spiritually stuck. Dr. Pranjal D Shharma have guided over 10,000 people, from common individuals to Bollywood stars, to transform challenges into opportunities.
